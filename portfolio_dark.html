                <p>The picture above is me during our first battle in FTC (first tech challenge) where me and a group of people in my school made a robot and got pretty far into the competition</p>
                <p>I was head programmer for my team, we started of with a blocks programm native to the hardware wich was based of off java, but we couldnt access it at home. So later on we switched over to just programming in java.</p>
                <p>I learned a good amount of java during this, but it was robotics java, wich besides the syntax is way different. So i dont really have any experience from this that is usefull during this study.</p>

                <p>As i mentioned before i absolutely love music, my dad loves music aswell and has been playing piano for basicly his whole life now.</p>
                <p>Because of that i grew up around music and have been bassicly addicted ever since, i have tried some instruments for myself including piano and guitar.</p>
                <p>But none of them really stuck to me, i have also tried my hand on music production but that was way harder then i excpected.</p>
                <p>But i still love music and listen to it all day every day, mainly listening to artists like gorrilaz, JID, Kendrick Lamar, Tame Impala, and so so many more</p>
